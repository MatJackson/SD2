# SOEN 341 - SD2
## Goal
Provide a platform through which a user can ask questions to a community of like minded individuals.
## Description
The site will provide users with the ability to search, post and reply to questions on any topic that they desire. To facilitate searches a tag system will be developed to help catagorize the questions. Though the search functions will work for all visitors, users will have to register/login to the website to post, reply, and vote on questions/answers. To ensure that the best answers rise to the top a upvote/downvote system will be implemented where users can upvote answers that they find helpful, or downvote those that are unhelpful or otherwise misleading.
